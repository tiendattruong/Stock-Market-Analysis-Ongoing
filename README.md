# Stock-Market-Analysis-Ongoing
In this notebook, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). We will learn how to use yfinance to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a machine learning method!

We'll be answering the following questions along the way:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?

3.) What was the correlation between different stocks?

4.) What was the Value at Risk of each stocks?

5.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using machine learning)
